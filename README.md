### Example
Before Cloud(on-Prem) for Online Shopping App
- peak usage during weekends / holidays
- Less load during rest of time
- higher cost of procuring infrastructure
- needs to plan ahead
- Dedicated server team to manage the infrastructure
- Going global takes a lot of time

### Why migrate to AWS Cloud?
https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/
- 20% infrastructure cost savings (autoscaling)
- 66% increase in administrator productivity
- 43% lower time to market for new features
- 29% increase in staff focus on innovation
- 45% fewer security-related incidents

These are some advantages of using cloud computing:
1. Cost Savings
2. Security
3. Flexibility
4. Mobility
5. Insight
6. Increased Collaboration
7. Quality Control
8. Disaster Recovery
9. Loss Prevention
10. Automatic Software Updates
11. Competitive Edge
12. Sustainability

Other advantages of cloud computing could include provisioning resources on demand (Elasticity).
Better resource utilization and no upfront cost. You can stop spending money to maintain a data center
and go global in minutes. There is no need of a dedicated server team to manage the infrastructure.

### What is the role of a devops Engineer?
As a devops engineer you will:
- work with IT team
- nderstand how developers work and collaborate
- Identify all manual tasks developers are doing
- create streamlined release processes
- Automate software development, deployment and release management
  - Setup CICD pipeline - to automate build and deployment
  - Automate infrastrcture setup
  - Automate Test execution process
  - Provide continuous feedback

The first challenge is to build basic Linux knowledge. We would then learn scripting in groovy, ruby, python or shell.
Next we would learn source control management. For instance, a client may want to migrate from Azure Devops to git:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/server

After that we would learn ansible and terraform for configuration management. Next we would learn Jenkins and Azure Devops. We would then learn monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
Next we would learn more about Azure or AWS. At the end of the process we would learn docker, containers, kubernetes and deploy
on EKS.

All the time the focus should be on global knowledge of Devops and other tools are learnt as extra. We should be consistent
in learning to ensure that we practice.
So the list of Devops would include:
- Learning Linux Admin basics
- Understand how SDLC, Agile works
- Learn any scripting language - Groovy, Python
- Learn Git, SCM
- Learn CICD tools
- Learn configuration management tools
- Learn Containers such as Docker
- Learn any Cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, GCP
- Learn Kubernetes for Container orchestration tools

### What is SDLC and What is Devops
DevOps is an approach to improving work in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) process. 

### Lab 0

For this lab we will create two virtual servers(EC2 instances) in AWS cloud. EC2 instances are virtual servers provided by AWS.
We will create two EC2 instances:
- One EC2 instance to set up Jenkins server
- Another EC2 instance for setting up Tomcat

What does CICD mean? Why do we need to follow CICD process during software development?

### Lab 1
We have now created an EC2 instance in AWS cloud. We will now setup Java, Maven and Jenkins on the EC2 instance:

This is the plan going forwards:

### What is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.
These are the phases of the software development life cycle:

The problem with waterfall is that the business needs to wait a long time to see the value in Waterfall.
Waterfall is more rigid and businesses cannot change requireements. Product owners are not involved during the devlopment.
In Agile changes are allowed even after the planning is complete. Agile is iterative development where businesses can see value
through demos of the work so far. Every story in agile is tested and delivered to product owners.
