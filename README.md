### Example
Before Cloud(on-Prem) for Online Shopping App
- peak usage during weekends / holidays
- Less load during rest of time
- higher cost of procuring infrastructure
- needs to plan ahead
- Dedicated server team to manage the infrastructure
- Going global takes a lot of time
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/232931468-459c8dbe-1e3f-42b6-9684-c7e9b2a3f601.png)

### Why migrate to AWS Cloud?
https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/
- 20% infrastructure cost savings (autoscaling)
- 66% increase in administrator productivity
- 43% lower time to market for new features
- 29% increase in staff focus on innovation
- 45% fewer security-related incidents

These are some advantages of using cloud computing:
1. Cost Savings
2. Security
3. Flexibility
4. Mobility
5. Insight
6. Increased Collaboration
7. Quality Control
8. Disaster Recovery
9. Loss Prevention
10. Automatic Software Updates
11. Competitive Edge
12. Sustainability

Other advantages of cloud computing could include provisioning resources on demand (Elasticity).
Better resource utilization and no upfront cost. You can stop spending money to maintain a data center
and go global in minutes. There is no need of a dedicated server team to manage the infrastructure.

### What is the role of a devops Engineer?
As a devops engineer you will:
- work with IT team
- nderstand how developers work and collaborate
- Identify all manual tasks developers are doing
- create streamlined release processes
- Automate software development, deployment and release management
  - Setup CICD pipeline - to automate build and deployment
  - Automate infrastrcture setup
  - Automate Test execution process
  - Provide continuous feedback

The first challenge is to build basic Linux knowledge. We would then learn scripting in groovy, ruby, python or shell.
Next we would learn source control management. For instance, a client may want to migrate from Azure Devops to git:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/server

After that we would learn ansible and terraform for configuration management. Next we would learn Jenkins and Azure Devops. We would then learn monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
Next we would learn more about Azure or AWS. At the end of the process we would learn docker, containers, kubernetes and deploy
on EKS.

All the time the focus should be on global knowledge of Devops and other tools are learnt as extra. We should be consistent
in learning to ensure that we practice.
So the list of Devops would include:
- Learning Linux Admin basics
- Understand how SDLC, Agile works
- Learn any scripting language - Groovy, Python
- Learn Git, SCM
- Learn CICD tools
- Learn configuration management tools
- Learn Containers such as Docker
- Learn any Cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, GCP
- Learn Kubernetes for Container orchestration tools

### What is SDLC and What is Devops
DevOps is an approach to improving work in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) process. 

### Lab 0

For this lab we will create two virtual servers(EC2 instances) in AWS cloud. EC2 instances are virtual servers provided by AWS.
We will create two EC2 instances:
- One EC2 instance to set up Jenkins server
- Another EC2 instance for setting up Tomcat

What does CICD mean? Why do we need to follow CICD process during software development?
https://www.coachdevops.com/2022/10/cicd-process-flow-diagram-implement.html

### Lab 1
We have now created an EC2 instance in AWS cloud. We will now setup Java, Maven and Jenkins on the EC2 instance:

### Roles and responsibilities of Devops Engineer
- Set up CICD pipeline - automate build and deployment
- Automate infrastructure setup
- Automate Test execution process
- Provide continuous feedback
- Devops Engineers should also understand how developers work and collaborate

### What is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.
These are the phases of the software development life cycle:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/233507028-17f690d3-ba6b-4cdd-829c-46adbccfec9e.png)

### Differences between Agile and Waterfall
Waterfall can be described as a linear process. The process starts with requirements gathering and ends with deployment.
Agile can be described as an iterative process. Each iteration leads to gradual improvement of the product.
The problem with waterfall is that the business needs to wait a long time to see the value in Waterfall.
Waterfall is more rigid and businesses cannot change requireements. Product owners are not involved during the devlopment.
In Agile changes are allowed even after the planning is complete. Agile is iterative development where businesses can see value
through demos of the work so far. Every story in agile is tested and delivered to product owners.

Devops is about people, process and technology.

### Differences between two images:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/233508308-28847d31-c1d0-43c9-8b22-fe751d406df5.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/233504961-fde76d00-0037-4dc0-8f20-a83fb84a73d7.png)

In the first image there is no automation. There are also silos between development and operations. There is no feedback loop.
There is collaboration with slack notifications. In the second diagram there are checks before pushing the code including sonarqube, jacoco and junit. There is security through artifactory
and security scanning. The testing takes place during the deployment stage and there is a difference between deployment and release.
In the second system we are able to fail fast and trouble shoot quickly.

In the first time diagram, we see agile development with stories. There are:
- manual builds
- manual tests on the machine
- manual deployments (time consuming)
- manual code coverage
- no feedback to production teams
- no binary repo manager
- manual infrastructure setup

In this example, developers are siloed and are not collaborating effectively and are unable to find out what they have done wrong.
In the first place, it is important to define the deployment plan. Take the code from inception to release.
The main difference is during the CI/CD part of the pipeline. Each time jenkins checks the code for code quality issues. We also integrated
with notifications such as slack. We also have a binary repo manager. We have a test environment and a production environment.
The model followed is build once and deploy anywhere. There are quality gates for each starge to ensure that quality is upheld.
Every time we deploy into the QA and UAT environments. The Jar file is stored on Artifactory and there is no manual build. The build
is completed using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Ansible. Devops is a practice that is followed by deployment teams.
Agile is a software development methodology. Agile closes the gap between business and developers and devops closes the gap between developers
and operations. 

Continuous Integration - Find bugs early in the software development stage
Continuous Delivery - Deploy code to production environment (build once and deploy anywhere) - fixed release by May 25
Continuous Deployment - Everything is automated - as soon as developer makes change it is deployed to production

### What does Faster to market mean?
Agile with Devops can help to reduce the time to market. It helps move the product to the market place quickly.
Build and packaging is when devops is most useful. With a brand new product how is devops useful? 80% of application is already in production.
Difficult to automate the process. Many not 50% unit test coverage. It is easier for devops to implement a green field project.

### Why Devops?
- Business value
  - faster time to market
  - continuous software delivery
  - better quality due to automation
  - improved performance
  - reduced outages - shorter lead times
  - better products
- Technical value:
  - communication between teams
  - faster resolution of problems
  - increased productivity - more time available to add value (rather than fix / maintain)
  - Infrastructure as code - environment is provisioned through code rather than manually

### Devops paradigms
1. Source code management
2. Continuous integration
3. Continuous delivery
4. Infrastructure As Code
5. Continuous Deployment
6. Code Quality tools integration
7. Monitoring
8. Microservices and Containerization
9. Container Orchestration

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/233512776-3b501018-2408-440b-a9f2-7632992c700e.png)

Being good at just the first three can help get a job: git, jenkins, terraform.

Sonarlint plugin locally runs the Sonarqube analysis on your code. It is a static code analysis tool. It is a plugin for eclipse and intellij.
This is quite useful for the rules on sonarqube:
https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-3252

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/233514223-23134295-62fd-42de-b883-a914e4206468.png)

Fortify is a security tool. Snyk is another vulnerability scanner. It is a tool that scans the code for vulnerabilities.
As a devops engineer the CyberSecurity team would be responsible for the product. Dynatrace is the responsibility of the monitoring team.
The Devops team is responsible for invoking the applications.

### Tools integration
How would we move from no automation to full cicd. First we need to set up an overview of the process.
We would then set up Jenkins and SonarQube. We would then set up Nexus to set up Artifactory. We would then slowly scale up. We
start with CI / CD, container management. 

Prospective employers will ask for you to show your github repositories. Project work is important.
We will take a problem and address that problem. When set up git bash.

Jenkins is the best tool for CI / CD. Jenkins is a CI / CD tool. It is a server that runs in the background. It is a java application.
In lab 0 we created two ec2 instances. One is the Jenkins server and the other is a tomcat server.

This is a reminder of the CI/CD process
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27693622/235010288-a584f159-a364-4e8e-a4fe-3194faae6710.png)

We will automate build, deployment and code coverage with jacoco. We will use a maven structure.
Maven gives us a project directory structure. We will use a maven project structure. We will use a maven project structure.
This link is useful for maven project structure:

### Lab 5 - How to make code changes to trigger Jenkins builds instantly
In this exercise we want to make a code change to ensure Jenkins has started automated builds/deployments instantly.
https://www.cidevops.com/2020/02/how-to-push-code-change-into-github.html

We are using this repository for connection with jenkins:
https://github.com/TomSpencerLondon/MyApplicationRepo

We can then refresh the browser and click on Source to see the code changes you made in our git bash window. 
Now after making this code change, if we have web hooks configured correctly, it should have triggered build in Jenkins instantly.

We just changed an exclamation mark on Howdy Folks but this has been reflected on our application which we have deployed to the Tomcat instance:
